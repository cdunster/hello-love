An introduction into using the LÃ–VE (love2d.org) framework.

# Current Implementation
* Enemy character (snake) scrolls across the top of the screen.
* Move your character (panda) with the `left` and `right` arrow keys.
* Hit the `space` key to shoot bullets upwards.
* When you hit the enemy its speed is increased.
* When you miss the game restarts.
