An introduction into using the LÃ–VE (love2d.org) framework.

# Current Implementation
* After `2 seconds` a circle will appear.
* `Space` key creates a new rectangle.
* `Arrow keys` move the rectangle(s) around the screen (only one arrow key at once is registered).
* Any time one or more `rectangle` collides with the `circle` all collided shapes will be filled in. The un-collided shapes will remain un-filled.
